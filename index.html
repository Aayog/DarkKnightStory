            Batman, the Caped Crusader, had always been the city's greatest defender, using his intellect and skills to
            solve crimes and bring down villains. But there was a secret that nobody knew - Batman was also a zombie.

            It was a strange condition, one that only affected him during the late hours of the night when his energy
            levels dropped. During these times, he would become consumed with an insatiable hunger for brains, which he
            sated by hacking into the minds of criminals.

            Despite the challenges of his condition, Batman continued to fight for justice, using his unique combination
            of skills to bring down even the most cunning of villains. He would often work through the night, hacking
            into computer systems and extracting information from the minds of criminals.

            One night, while investigating a string of high-profile burglaries, Batman realized that the mastermind
            behind the robberies was none other than Lucius Fox, a former colleague of his at Wayne Enterprises. It
            appeared that Fox was using his knowledge of the security systems to plan the perfect heist.

            Batman knew he had to act fast, but as he closed in on Fox, his condition worsened. His hunger for brains
            became unbearable, and he felt his body weakening. Nevertheless, he pushed on, determined to bring the
            criminal to justice.

            Finally, he tracked Fox to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city. Batman burst in, and after a
            brief struggle, managed to apprehend the thief.

            With the case closed, Batman retreated to his secret lair, where he could safely let his condition run its
            course. As the sun rose, he felt his body slowly return to normal. He knew that he had saved the city once
            again, using his unique combination of skills to bring down criminals and solve the toughest of cases.

            Despite the challenges of his unusual condition, Batman remained committed to fighting for justice, his
            legend only growing with each new tale of the Dark Knight who could hack into minds and bring down villains,
            all while battling his own inner demons.
